If you want to add something to PMDate, it would be greatly appreciated to:

  - add tests for new methods
  - add tests for any modifications to existing methods
  - use a 4 spaces (aka no TAB) indentation
  - use the [Allman indentation style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style)
  
Thank you.
